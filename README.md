## Steps:

(Make sure squirrel is connected to internet)

### Update packages:
#### root@squirrel# opkg update



### Install hostapd:
#### root@squirrel# opkg install hostapd



### Edit wireless file:
A wireless file should already be created in /etc/config

remove "option disabled 1" from  /etc/config/wireless

> *Note: if wireless file is not configured properly for your driver type, you may need to reconfigure. 
> Issue these commmands to erase and reload configuration while your driver is pluged into Squirrel:
> #### root@squirrel# rm -f /etc/config/wireless
> #### root@squirrel# wifi detect > /etc/config/wireless 


Once the device(network adapter) interface on /etc/config/wireless is properly configured, all the file needs is a wifi interface defining the network that sits on top of the device(network adapter).

Here is an example: 

config wifi-iface\
option device     wl0\
option network    wireless\
option mode       ap\
option ssid       MyWifiAP\
option encryption psk2\
option key        secret passphrase

### Build and store the network configuration:
> Refer to the [network](https://github.com/interminable10/NetmodeEvil/blob/master/config/network) file on this respitory to view the full contents of this configuration file.
#### nano /usr/lib/network_config/evil
place your desired network configurations for this network mode on this file as it will not be overwritten.





### Edit contents of /usr/bin/NETMODE:
Within the case statement of this file, a new netmode named "EVIL" should be added.


"EVIL") cp /usr/lib/network_config/evil /etc/config/network\
/etc/init.d/firewall disable\
/etc/init.d/firewall stop\
;;

### Editing DHCP file:
For the internal DHCP server to run how we want on the Squirrel, we must configure the network 'wan' to be ignored and the network 'wireless' to run. 

config dhcp 'wireless'\
	option interface 'wireless'\
	option start '100'\
	option limit '150'\
	option leasetime '12h'\
	option dhcpv6 'server'\
	option ra 'server'

condig dhcp 'wan'\
	option interface 'wan'\
	option ignore '1'

 > Refer to the [DHCP](https://github.com/interminable10/NetmodeEvil/blob/master/config/DHCP) file on this respitory to view the full contents of this configuration file.






### Editing payloads/switch3/payload.sh:

> It is worth noting we chose to run this configuration on payload 3 as the openvpn service is not being used for 
> this scenerio.


  /usr/bin/NETMODE VPN\
} || {\
	# replace BRIDGE with EVIL for seperated network AP\
	/usr/bin/NETMODE EVIL

> Refer to the [payload](https://github.com/interminable10/NetmodeEvil/blob/master/config/payload) file on this respitory to view the full contents of this configuration file.
